	<h3>Who we are</h3>
    <p>We are a small group of professional technical writers, led by <a href="cv/cv-dark.html"><a href="cv.html">Toma Kashamov</a></a>, a senior expert in the field. We compose, edit and deliver technical content fot the IT community. 
	<br><br>
	We like to innovate, experiment and resort to harsh measures with the solid goal of making technical documentation better for everybody.</p>

	<h3>Some words about Toma</h3>  
  <p>Toma Kashamov is the founder and key figure behind <strong>techwriters.eu</strong>. Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, his story in writing begins ever since he was a kid. He had a passion for writing and learning for languages, which actually helped shape his linguistic skills, even though he did not realize it at the time.</p>
  
  <h4>Becoming a translator</h4>
    <p>In college times he knew he had to find a job. His fluency in English helped him find translation projects English to Bulgarian and vice-versa. But English is the most popular language for translations and competition was harsh. To keep the inflow of projects, he had to stick to one of the less coveted options that were still popular: legal or technical texts.</p>
    <p>Being a student in the Technical University of Sofia makes such a decision look like an easy one, but it wasn't a smooth start. In the beginning, he did try with both legal and technical documents. However, this proved time-costly and rather prevented him from keeping his focus and getting traction with customers. So the decision was made: in the late 90s he started taking more and more technical content translation projects and was forced to ditch most others.</p>
      
  <h4>Becoming a writer</h4>
    <p>By the time Toma graduated the TU of Sofia, he had established relations with a list of clients who kept him busy for a while. But little did he know that as his abilities with linguistics and his ways with the keyboard evolved, so did his passion to write literature. He started authoring poems, short stories and  generated a fair amount of literary content, predominantly in Bulgarian. This is not something one decides upon or trends into: he realized it was his destiny to become a writer.</p>
  
  <h4>Going IT and becoming a tech writer</h4>  
    <br><br>
    <p>Prior to getting his first job in an IT company as a technical writer, Toma has managed to establish a name for himself as a writer. He was still involved with translations of technical content but had also translated books, created content for numerous websites, including copywriting. And this is where it took off: his first job in an IT company was combining roles of a content writer, a technical writer and coordinator of releases across the RnD and Marketing teams.
