## Why crypto?

It breaks our heart that as late as towards the end of 2023, there are still people who openly question the motivation for crypto; or openly label it "a scam".

So, while we are well aware that there is a long way to go, let us make it clear why techwriters.eu have a stance on crypto:

> **What is a crypto currency?** 
> Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currencies that use blockchain technology.

A "reliable" cryptocurrency project must clearly meet several criteria: 

1. Is entirely *decentralized*: no single decision can make the network perform in favor of one user group over the others.
2. Holds all transaction history in a public *ledger* where each and every transaction is recorded and chronologically stored until eternity. No one can delete a record. Ever.
3. Supports *immutability of transactions*: once a tx is submitted and logged in the ledger, it is unstoppable within the network.
4. Is robustly *encrypted* so that no one can mess with transactions.
5. Allows every user to own their private key(s), thus allowing *digital ownership* over any wallet address you have the key to, hence the assets it holds.
6. Is *trustless*, so no third-party will ever be needed for the network to operate. Central banks particularly dislike this part. 
7. Is open source so that no one can sneak in chunks of malicious code unnoticed.

There are other characteristics and the discussion is long. Like, really long. The key take-away here is that these criteria are the pillars of the concept of *decentralized finance*: which is intended to guarantee financial freedom of the network users.

However, one of the caveats that crypto might fall into, is simply the current Internet: the widely used web2, or as we call it, **the Internet!**, is centralized and under the rule of governments and agencies across the world. This means that they can easily ban crypto trading or mining, and not just that.

So this is one of the reasons Web3 started to gain attention. 

## Why web3?

Because 3 > 2 so it's better, duuh?
