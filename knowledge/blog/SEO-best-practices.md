## Onpage SEO: keywords in content

1. Choose a keyword.
2. Make sure you have this keyword in the Title.
3. Make sure you have this keyword in the First paragraph (or first 100 words on the page).
4. Make sure you have this keyword used in the rest of the webpage content.


## What do you need to rank high?

You webpage (website) must:

1. Have outstandingly good content (i.e. *the best content*).
2. Have original content.
3. Satisfy search intent.


## 5 steps to best SEO

1. Find 5 keywords: must be *consistent with your business* and must be *low competition ones* + usually *long-tail keywords*.
2. Create catchy content around these 5 keywords: one that satisfies search intent.
3. Optimize content for on-page SEO.
4. Optimize content for user experience: make it user centric, not keyword centric
   Backlinks are not as important as they were in the past. They are still important but Google now ranks *how happy your users* are (back to search intent).
   Google watches for cases when users bounce back to search results (bounce rate). When people quickly bounce back - that's bad. And the opposite: if users remain on your website after visiting your website, you might get a raise in rankings.
   So, the tips are:
   * to frontload the value as much as possible. Do not get unnecessary lengthy intros, better jump right into it
   * watch for content layout and design
   * care about readability (see Yoast). Have a good font + fontsize, right spacing and good structure: Top Heading and well distributed subheadings
5. Build backlinks - that's how Google acknowledges that your website is authoritative and trustworthy
   1. Be the source: so you have to be creative about topics that are unique and that you are the first to provide reliable info. Works really good with e.g. stats regarding your industry
