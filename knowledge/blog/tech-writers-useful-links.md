# Quick list to tech writing links

Welcome to **techwriters.eu**! I'm not getting tired of typing that sentence. 

> **Disclaimer:**
> Initially , this article will just contain a several links. Gradually, I will add more meaningful content, that will answer some questions like:
> How did we come up with **techwriters.eu** or why we love W3.CSS? It will build up to a meaningful article.

## Useful resources for technical writers

So, there are a few categories I put the resources into. Every single one of these links has helped me build **techwriters.eu**.

### HTML and tech writing

HTML is the widely popular markup language for structuring web page content. 

* [HTML tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - well, this is must for technical writers;
* [2-way converter of HTML to WYSIWYG and vice-versa](https://html-online.com/editor/) - really useful for snippets of WYSIWYG text (like MS Word) that you can easily transform into HTML; and the other way around.

### CSS and styling tech content

Some would argue tech writers do not need to style their docs because we have tools to do that for us. However, CSS is still an unexplored land and it offers some amazing simplistic visuals that are perfect for technical documentation, representation and direction of focus.

* [CSS tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - a simple, in fact, great tutorial on CSS;
* [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - a great website on CSS tweaks;
* [W3.CSS tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) - TechWriters.eu uses a few of the W3.CSS themes as provided by W3Schools.

### JS and interactive tech content

Usually, Javascript (and its various incarnations) are not a must-have for the toolbox of a tech writer. However, with advancement of doc-as-code platforms, some knowledge on scripting languages definitely helps. Javascript (widely known as JS) is a scripting language that is intended to execute on the client side and runs natively across all major web browsers.

* [Javascript tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - a fun tutorial for beginners;
* [jQuery tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) - a step further with JS, jQuery is actually simpler for some tasks;
* [React tutorial at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp) - React is yet another JS framework; the Docusaurus doc-as-code platform utilizes React.

### Fonts and charsets

Fonts are widely ignored. Some tech writers do not even understand what charsets are and how they are used.

* [HTML charsets](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/default.asp) - learn about the use of Unicode, UTF-8, ASCII and some cool symbols;
* [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) - you either love it or love it;, no other way around; we used ver 4.6.7 but there is [ver 6](https://fontawesome.com/v6/icons/) as of Oct. 2023.

### Miscellaneous

* [Amazing tips from W3Schools: the How to section](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) - a ton of cool ways to cater to you inner developer
* [I'd rather be writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/) - arguably the most comprehensive source of tech writing tips and tricks on the web;
* [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - the open source doc hosting platform that allows you to utilize Sphinx and MkDocs.

## Final words

As the sole bearer of the name Toma Kashamov, I built **techwriters.eu** from scratch, using raw HTML, CSS, a bit of JS, and markdown. I've utilized a few W3.CSS themes for different sections in this website. 

However, it is the team who reviewed and helped shape the content here. Enjoy our blog section.

Oh, lest we forget, I want to remind you all: coding is fun! I love to explore different and simplistic ways to present technical content to make it more effective and interactive.
