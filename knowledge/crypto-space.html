      <h2 id="why-crypto">Why crypto? </h2>
      <p>It breaks our hearts that as late as towards the end of 2023, there are still people who openly question the motivation for crypto; or openly label it "a scam".</p>
      <p>So, while we are well aware that there is a long way to go, let us make it clear why <a href="http://techwriters.eu">techwriters.eu</a> have a stance on crypto:</p>
      <blockquote id="dark-quote">
        <p><strong>What is a crypto currency?</strong><br>
        Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currencies that use blockchain technology.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A "reliable" cryptocurrency project must clearly meet several criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Is entirely <em>decentralized</em>: no single decision or entity can coerce or manipulate the network to perform in favor of one user group over the others.</li>
          <li>Holds all transaction history in a public <em>ledger</em> where each and every transaction is recorded and chronologically stored in the blockchain until eternity. No one can delete a record. Ever.</li>
          <li>Supports <em>immutability of transactions</em>: once a tx is submitted and logged in the ledger, it is unstoppable within the network.</li>
          <li>Is robustly <em>encrypted</em> so that no one can mess with transactions.</li>
          <li>Allows every user to own their private key(s), thus allowing <em>digital ownership</em> over any wallet address you have the key to, hence the assets it holds.</li>
          <li>Is <em>trustless</em>, so no third-party will ever be needed for the network to operate. Central banks particularly dislike this part.</li>
          <li>Has a transparent and well-structured and planned tokenomics (token-based economics) model.</li>
          <li>Is open source so that no one can sneak in chunks of malicious code.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>There are other characteristics and the discussion is long. Like, really long. The key take-away here is that these criteria are the pillars of the concept of a truly <em>decentralized</em> financial model: which is intended to guarantee financial freedom of the network users.</p>
      <p>However, one of the major caveats that crypto might fall into, is simply the current Internet: the widely used Web2, or as we call it, <strong>the Internet!</strong>, is centralized and under the rule of governments and agencies across the world. This means that they can easily ban crypto trading or mining, and not just that.</p>
      <p>So this is one of the reasons for Web3 to emerge as a concept of the decentralized internet.</p>
      <h2 id="why-Web3">Why Web3? </h2>
      <p>Because 3 &gt; 2 so it's better, duuh?</p>
      <p>Seriously, the idea of a decentralized internet effectively means that no one owns the Internet, uhm, technically speaking. Some would argue that the current Internet belongs to no one but in truth, a few tech corporations own the largest chunk of all web activity.</p>
      <h3 id="what-is-decentralized-internet">What is Decentralized Internet? </h3>
      <p>This is the conceptual part so just submerge yourself into it.<br>
      The TL;DR is that it is based on a blockchain model, much similar to crypto and NFTs but all websites and apps run on top and you can even earn some cash, even end users. ISPs responsibilities would be distributed across the nodes that operate the blockchain, which is natively hooked to the application layer. Thus exchange of data is attached to transactions and this adds incentivization to Web3. So, it is again servers and services but operations and payload are all paid for depending on the tokenomics model.</p>
      <p>The end users would essentially have experience, similar to Web2: they will be use web apps and access websites in a similar way. Depending on economics models in these apps, some users would be able to monetize on web 3.</p>
      <h3 id="how-is-Web3-a-cryptocurrency">How is Web3 a cryptocurrency? </h3>
      <p>First of all, the idea of crypto itself is beyond just a cryptocurrency already. The success of long-term cryptocurrencies usually lies in the tokenomics models and development of the crypto protocols' capabilities.</p>
      <p>So back to the question: ideally, all the protocols that operate Web3 networks will seamlessly interact with one another to form the ecosystem of Web3. There is a lot to happen and we probably don't even know a huge chunk of what technology will achieve.</p>
      <p>It is not the subject of this article to name specific projects, so we won't.</p>
