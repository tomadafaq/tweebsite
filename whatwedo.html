        <!-- We do Doc portals -->
        <h3>All about doc portals</h3>
        <p>Doc portals is what we call any web hosted library of technical documentation. If your library consists of PDFs and/or Word docs, Excel sheets and other supplementary standalone files, that is not really a doc portal. </p>
        
        <h4>Create doc portals from scratch</h4>
        <p>Thats is usually what startup companies need. Whether it is developer's docs, pluggable components, APIs or SDKs, we know what to do. Usually, you just need to decide if you want a CMS or would rather go with a Git repo for the job. The rest is up to us.</p>
                
        <h4>Migrate doc portals to better platforms</h4>
        <p>Usually it happens with companies with a long history that offer multiple products and services. It is hard enough to maintain all documentation sets for all products but as content grows bigger, so do challenges with migrating it to something better. Moving everything from one platform to another is not a simple task: everything you do must be searchable and it's often impossible, for example, to export and import images. We knwo the challenges and are able to do it for you. We also help make the right decisions with all of the above plus so much more.</p>
        
        <h4>Reorganize doc portals & update existing documentation</h4>
        <p>If you have existing doc portal, but aren't happy with its content; or receive negative feedback from your users, we're here to help. You might need help on proof-reading & editing, restructuring of sections, or simply applying best practices. We can consult you on what to do; or you can hire us to do it for you. Depending on the size of your documentation, this may turn out to be a very cumbersome task. <strong>Reorganizing a doc portal</strong> is not easy and often requires you to convey a research in order to identify the weakest spots to address. 
        </p>
        <p>We also <strong>update existing documentation</strong>. Updates vary from simple refreshing of images to match the latest UI, to breaking down sections, or removing obsolete content. Don't forget we also do diagrams, videos, GIFs and utilize all forms of visuals, for example font-awesome icons, etc. </p>
          <p>We have experience with doc portals.</p>
